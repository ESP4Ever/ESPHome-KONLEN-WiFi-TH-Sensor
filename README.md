# ESPHome YAML and a customized tm1638 display driver for KONLEN WiFi Temperature & Humidity Sensor
WARNING:
 - Please note that I don't know if this device still ESP8266-based so check it before buying!
 - The I2C external sensor will not work due to GPIO conflict and shall be replaced to one from DHT series. I used AM2302
 - This project is obsolete and may require code updates.
